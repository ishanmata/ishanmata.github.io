### Free/Libre and Open Source Software
I am a user of FOSS, and highly recommend to others as well to reject proprietary software as far as possible. [Here][stallmantalk] is a brief talk by Richard Stallman on why we should do so.
Some useful FOSS are:
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) (Operating system)
- LibreOffice suite (relacement for MS Word/Excel etc)
- Firefox
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) (Note taking software)
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (Bibliography management)
- K9 mail (Email client for mobiles and tablets)
