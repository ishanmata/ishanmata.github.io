# About me
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Indian Statistical Institute (Delhi Center). Prior to this, I did my PhD at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science -- Pilani.

My area of work is differential cohomology. During my PhD I mainly studied differential characters (which are a differential refinement of *ordinary/singular* cohomology) and their relationship to families of flat connections on vector bundles. I am now studying the Atiyah--Singer index theory and differential K-theory. 

More broadly, I am interested in exploring the interactions between Differential Geometry, Algebraic Topology, and Physics. In the long run, I wish to learn subjects such as:
- *generalised* differential cohomology theories and their relationship to M-theory
- higher categories and higher gauge theories,
- $$L_\infty$$ algebras and their relationship to classical field theory and string theory
- bundle gerbes, and
- applications of differential K-theory to T-duality in String Theory. 

Apart from Mathematics and Physics, I am interested in the RTI Act and Constitutional law. Am also an FOSS enthusiast. 

I like to connect with like minded people. If you too share any of the above interests (mathematical or otherwise), do drop me an email! I would love to hear from you.
